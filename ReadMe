My name is Orla Fitzmaurice. I am in my final year of the Statistics Route of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Limerick(UL).

I am pasionate about applying my Maths and Stats skills to real world problems - this is why I find the areas of ML and Data Science so intriguing!

I am a keen communicator - I love working as a tutor at UL. I find it rewarding getting the chance to help other students understand coding concepts. 

This is my public repositry to showcase some of my coding skills - check out my linkedIn here to see what other skills I have: https://www.linkedin.com/in/orla-fitzmaurice/
